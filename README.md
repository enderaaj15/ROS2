The following projects showcase the ROS2 skills I acquired during my training at Move Robotic Sdn Bhd, as part of the Malaysian Technology Development Corporation (MTDC) K-Youth Programme initiative by Khazanah Nasional Berhad. I worked on 12 projects, with assignments 1-9 being individual while assignments 10-12 are team projects.
I am currently adding/polishing each assignments before uploading them here. Expect all 12 assignments to be here soon!
